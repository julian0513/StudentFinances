This is my 2nd ever project, I made it right after I wrapped up my full-stack web based StatsCalculator.

I wanted to make this project because I wanted to try and help younger students like myself gain a little bit of insight on finances for young students in this current generation.

I also was able to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript a lot because this project is entirely front end and is hosted through here, unlike the StatsCalculator, which had a Java backend and is hosted on Heroku.

Enjoy :)
