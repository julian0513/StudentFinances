                <strong>- Financial Aid -</strong><br><br>

                In College, Financial Aid is your best friend essentially.<br><br>

                Financial Aid comes in many forms, and for the majority of students, it is what allows them to afford school and survive financially while studying.<br><br>

                The three main forms of financial aid are: Scholarships/Grants, Subsidized Student Loans, and Unsubsidized Loans.<br><br>

                <strong>- Tips -</strong><br><br>

                Here are some important things to keep in mind.<br><br>

                It's essential to maintain as high of a GPA as you can throughout High School and College (yes it sounds cliché), but it's true. Scholarships can often be the sole reason some students are able to attend College.<br><br>

                Make sure you have adequate community service hours for local scholarship opportunities as well; they come in handy and allow you to engage with your community.<br><br>

                You can also qualify for federal grants based on your family's income level and the number of siblings or dependents they or you provide for. These are free and don’t need to be paid back. You apply for these on the official FAFSA government website.<br><br>

                Another important thing to consider is that with grants and scholarships, you can essentially be paid to attend college.<br><br>

                Ex: Say you have $5,000 in tuition to pay, but $10,000 in financial aid; you get a check for $5,000 every semester AFTER your classes have already been paid for.<br><br>

                So please, as I'm sure you've heard millions of times already, keep up with your grades and apply for scholarships; they will make a massive impact on your financial well-being. We'll discuss student loans in the next section.
