        <strong>- JOBS -</strong><br><br>

        Traditionally, students in High School or in College take on regular jobs that roughly pay minimum wage and allocate around 20 hours a week on average.<br><br>

        At first glance, 20 hours a week may not seem like a lot. However, it's always important to consider your school schedule and workload to ensure adequate time is being set for your studies.<br><br>

        Popular job search-engine websites such as Indeed or ZipRecruiter are very useful in finding open positions, but always be sure to check the direct website for the company or place you plan to work for under their "Careers" section.<br><br>

        <strong>- INCOME -</strong><br><br>

        Now let's talk income.<br><br>

        As previously mentioned, we will take a conservative average and estimate the weekly salary for someone working minimum wage ($15) at 20 hours a week.<br><br>

        Before Medicare and Social Security taxes, that's $300, however, after subtracting taxes, you net roughly $276.<br><br>

        Times that by 4, your monthly income is roughly $1,104, if you work 20 hours a week at $15.<br><br>

        Another important thing to consider is your current situation, whether you have bills, car insurance, phone payments, etc.<br><br>

        As a rule of thumb, always live within your means and be fiscally conservative just in case of emergencies, but it's ok to set money aside for social activities.
